# Awful Green Things Epilogue
A Python implementation of the epilogue from 'Awful Green Things from Outer Space' board game so you don't have to roll all those dice manually just to figure out who won.

## Running
In Python 3.10 or later, run the `Awful Green Things.py` file. You will also need the instruction booklet that comes with the board game to interpret its results.

I've also put it on REPL.IT for [running it in a web browser](https://replit.com/@IFcoltransG/AwfulGreenThingsEpilogue), if you don't mind it being slow.
